  - Text Analysis:
      description: Text Analysis or Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a way for computers 
                   to analyze, understand, and derive meaning from human language in a smart
                   and useful way. By utilizing NLP, developers can organize and structure 
                   knowledge to perform tasks such as automatic summarization, translation, 
                   named entity recognition, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis, 
                   speech recognition, and topic segmentation.
  - Machine Learning:
      description:  Machine learning is a set of mathematical approaches to teaching computers to
                    learn based on large quantities of data, instead of human step by step instruction. 
                    There are many categories of Machine Learning including Natural Language Processing, 
                    Computer Vision, Time Series, and more.

  - Deep Learning:
      description: Deep Learning is at the cutting edge of what machines can do, and developers 
                   and business leaders absolutely need to understand what it is and how it works. 
                   This unique type of algorithm has far surpassed any previous benchmarks for 
                   classification of images, text, and voice .
